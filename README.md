# B2B-Courier-Analysis
Repo for a model that analyzes whether courier companies are charging the right prices.

# Overview
* This model seeks to ensure that B2B services where a corporation relies on courier companies for order deliveries are fairly charged.
* The repo provides an output of the proportion of orders that were overcharged, undercharged, or correctly charged by the servicing courier company.
* The model requires five datasets:
    * Courier company charges
    * Invoices
    * Order report
    * Pincodes
    * SKU-Master
* Libraries such as pandas and plotly were used.
* The model removes unidentified columns, calculates the expected charge, and visualizes the output.

# Notes
* Although a specific data set is used for this model, it can be easily altered to cater for other datasets.
* Data was acquired from www.statso.io
